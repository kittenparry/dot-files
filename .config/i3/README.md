## My i3 settings
Used [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ze0DjYv5DbCv9vNEzFmP6sU7ZmkGzcf) video series as a guide.

* [playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl) is needed for media keys (and possibly `pactl` if you're not on Ubuntu).
* `feh` is for setting background image.
* `arandr` is used to generate the `xrandr` output with the addition of `--rate 59.94`.
* [Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) for icon fonts ([cheatsheet](https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet)).
