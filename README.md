# My rice

* Currently not much modified apart from the `polybar` to some extend.
* Over all still learning ricing, Linux and Arch.

### Notes
I can recall them off the top of my head and they are pretty basic anyway but if I ever leave for too long and forget. In case.

* `pstree` process tree `-p` for PIDs, good with `kill $PID`.
* `chmod +x $file` adds execution permission to file.
* `pacman -Si` for package information, `-Ss` to search.
* `grep $word` helps filtering output.
* `screenfetch` or `neofetch` for fanciness and some info.
* `xprop` to get information on programs.
* `htop` system monitor, `ranger` file manager.
* `man` above all.
* `cmatrix`.
