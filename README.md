# My rice

* Root of this repository is basically the home directory.
* Currently not much modified apart from the `polybar` to some extend.
* Over all still learning ricing, Linux and Arch.

### Notes
I can recall them off the top of my head and they are pretty basic anyway but if I ever leave for too long and forget. In case.

* `pstree` process tree `-p` for PIDs, good with `kill $PID`.
* `chmod +x $file` adds execution permission to file.
* `pacman -Si` for package information, `-Ss` to search.
* `grep $word` helps filtering output.
* `screenfetch` or `neofetch` for fanciness and some info.
* `xprop` to get information on programs.
* `htop` system monitor, `ranger` file manager.
* `man` above all.
* `cmatrix`.
* `fltrdr` spritz-ish reading in terminal.
	* space, play/pause.
	* v, toggle full line.
	* increase/decrease i/I left, o/O right side.
	* h/l prev/next word.
	* j/k decrease/increase wpm.
	* H/L prev/next sentence.
	* J/K prev/next chapter.
	* //? search forward/backward.
	* n/N go to next/prev search.
* `du` to check disk space a folder is taking.
* `df` disk space of all places.
